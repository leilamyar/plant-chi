# Steps

## Build the project
- create folders
- add files
  - index (+ gen html snippet)
  - title in meta tag
  - viewport meta data (if relevant)
- connect files

_from there: look at the wbs’ mockup, check the different components & what they “need” to work / what they’re made of :_ __layout__, __props__, __content__ (images, text …)

## Navbar 
(this is probably the 1st thing we do)
- 4 links, 1 being a logo
- name or logo

_from there: the majority of our time is going to be spent on the main component (on that tuto, it’s the grid of pictures)_

## Portfolio item grid
- images
- titles
- descriptions
- animations
- JS (for animation)

_then, check the other pages of the wbs_

## Cards item grid
- layout : ??????????????????????????????????????????????
- block containers : 1 title + cards ) ??? fn du layout ???
- cards : 
  - name
  - description
  - image
  - text content

## Home page
- block text
- block CTA (reservation)

## Footer
- contact
  - address / phone / mail
- copyright section

## Handle links
- hover, etc.
